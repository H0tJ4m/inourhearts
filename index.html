        <p>To Prachi,</p>
        <p>Today, I embark on a significant journey in my life, venturing to the summit of Kalsubai, 
        the highest peak in Maharashtra, home to the sacred temple of Goddess Kalsubai. 
        As I ascend, my thoughts will be filled with prayers for you, beseeching the Goddess to alleviate 
        all the obstacles in your life and to bless you with immense joy and contentment.
        You might find this message a bit nerdy, but it's my unique way of showing my affection for you. 
        Hold onto these words until I return safely to your side. Await my return, for soon we shall be reunited.</p>
